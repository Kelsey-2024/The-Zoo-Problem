          Home was once the wild, now it's the Zoo for our Black Bears
          Ollie and Mona. These two were found scavanging for food around 
          human-occupied areas, so the siblings were moved here in 20XX. 
          Their favorite meals are seafood, fruit, and honey. On a Summer day 
          you'll find them sun-bathing, as well as exhausting playful energy. 
          We can't say the same during the Winter, but swing around the caves
          to watch them hirbernate!

          Welcome to the swamp habitat, home to the prehistoric
          dinosaurs Wren, Aspen, and Mika. These alligators reside
          in the heart of the zoo's reptile exhibit. Starting off with
          Wren, the largest and the oldest of the trio -- be careful, this 
          old guy has a bad temper and always gets first dibs on meals, or else. 
          Aspen is a master of disguise and never stays in one place, 
          good luck finding her in the swamp. Our youngest Mika exudes 
          infectious youth to those who encounter her.

          Welcome to the liveliest and loudest part of the exhibit, also
          known as home to our howler primates Earl, Cookie, and Banana Pudding.
          Together these three form a tight-knit family unit, 
          bound by a shared sense of camaraderie and adventure. 
          As they swing through the branches of their habitat, 
          howling excitedly amongst themselves, they serve as a 
          reminder of how beautiful and complex the natural world is.

      <h2>Giraffes</h2>

          Frankie, also known as Frank, is a 5 year-old male giraffe. This
          young bull wasn't born in the Zoo, a local santuary donated him 
          to us. Normally, newcomers need some time to get used to their new
          roommates, but that's not the case in this story. This young bull
          became well acquainted with our other giraffe, Coconut. It's almost
          as if he fell head over hooves the moment he saw her and we she feels
          the same way. These two were destined for each other. Coconut, also 
          known as Coco, is a 4 year-old female giraffe. She was the first 
          giraffe born at the Zoo, woo-hoo! Love should have been her first name
          because her birthday is February 14th. Her favorite times of the day 
          are meal time, naptime, and Frankie time.
